# 249Analytica_Shinkansen_Travel_Experience

Problem Statement
This problem statement is based on the Shinkansen Bullet Train in Japan, and passengers’ experience with that mode of travel. This machine-learning exercise aims to determine the relative importance of each parameter with regard to their contribution to the passengers’ overall travel experience. The dataset contains a random sample of individuals who travelled on this train. The on-time performance of the trains along with passenger information is published in a file named ‘Traveldata_train.csv’. These passengers were later asked to provide their feedback on various parameters related to the travel along with their overall experience. These collected details are made available in the survey report labelled ‘Surveydata_train.csv’.

Goal:
The goal of the problem is to predict whether a passenger was satisfied or not considering his/her overall experience of traveling on the Shinkansen Bullet Train.
